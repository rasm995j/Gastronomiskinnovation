<!-- Section 1 Is insects better than red meat? -->

        <h1>Is insects better than red meat?</h1>
        <p><b>THE NEW SUPERFOOD</b> is always on the news or the headline of food magazines and it is quite honestly just getting annoying. A sustenance that benefits you with everything is impossible to create. Therefore, will I state from the start that insects <b>are not</b> a superfood and you will find problems if you chose to live with a 100% insect-based diet.<br><br>
            With that out of the way we can now start praising the insects for all their glory. There are so many different types of edible insects and they are great sources of sustenance. If they are sourced and cooked correctly, then they can contain a log of protein, minerals and essential fats.<br><br>
            Compared to red meat, insects do look like a sensible option. Ground beef contains a lot of protein but guess what, grasshoppers contain exactly the same! Of cause you have to eat quite a few because of their small size, but it is still extraordinary how much protein they contain.<br><br>
            Caterpillars are the same. They also pack a huge punch of protein and are much more nutritious than a dull beef. A mopane caterpillar contains 48 – 61 percent protein, compared to just 14 – 24 percent in the average beef mince and 40 percent in a steak. Again, the size and weight must be taken into consideration.<br><br>
            We all know there is ‘good’ fat and ‘bad’ fat. Industrially-produced trans-fat, found in fast food, is linked to heart disease and obesity. This won’t be found in mealworms. Instead mealworms contain omega fatty acids, essential in a good diet.<br><br>
            Even palm weevil larvae are good for you. They contain twice the average zinc found in beef. Though beef is known for containing both zinc and iron, but our trusty mopane caterpillars contain between 5 and 12 times more iron than beef. That means a mixture of palm weevil larvae and mopane caterpillars are a perfect stand-in for beef.

<!-- Section 2 Does insects taste good? -->
<section id="taste" class="taste">
    <div class="backgroundColor">
        <h1>Does insects taste good?</h1>
        <p>The next big question is, do insects really taste good? Well, I’m glad you asked, because it seems like there is a huge range of extraordinary flavors that people are missing out on. Many have a high concentration of fat, and though we might not all admit it, we do know that things with a lot of fat tend to be delicious. As stated before, insects are a source of ‘good’ fat – omega 3 and others.<br><br>
            Take for example the Witjuti, or Witchetty grub. This moth larvae are eaten by aboriginals in Australia. It is filled with fat acids, especially omega-9. When you roast it on an open fire, the skin crisps up like roast chicken, and the flesh is said to taste like peanut butter or almonds.<br><br>
            Insects like mealworms and other larvae are often described to taste as nuts or like roasted seeds. This even makes sense given the high fat concentration of all these insects.<br><br>

<!-- Section 3 Will it save the world? -->
<section id="save" class="save">
    <div class="backgroundColor">
        <h1>Will it save the world?</h1>
        <p>Since the meat production is making such a pressure on the planet’s ecology, a change to an abundant, nutritional and low-impact food source could in fact save the world. In 2013, the United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization argued in their report that by 2050 we will be around 9 billion people on the planet. Therefore, we need to find a new way of growing and producing food. The current food production is not sustainable. We are literally addicted to meat, especially beef. That is a major cause of water shortage and deforestation. Research has shown that producing one ounce of beef requires around 100 gallons of water.<br><br>
            Production of insects take up much less land and the gas production are also far less than livestock, therefore the environmental impact is thought to be much lower. There are currently around 2030 documented edible insect species – and still counting. Wageningen University is keeping an updated list on their website.<br><br>
            The mass-production of insect based food does sound very beneficial, but we are still at an early stage. For instance, much is made from the high nutrition conversion rate of insects compared to conventional livestock and poultry, making insects one solution to the protein needs of mankind. Nutrition conversion means how efficiently we can convert food into body mass and it is the basis for the claims that mass-production of insects can be very environmentally beneficial.<br><br>
